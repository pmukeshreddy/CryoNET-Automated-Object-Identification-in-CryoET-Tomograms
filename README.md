CryoNET: Automated Object Identification in CryoET Tomograms


CryoNET is an automated pipeline designed to identify objects within Cryo-Electron Tomography (CryoET) tomograms. This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook (dec-23.ipynb) that demonstrates the complete workflowâ€”from data preprocessing and model inference to visualization of detected objects. The aim is to streamline the identification of biological macromolecules in high-resolution tomographic data.

Features
Automated Detection: Leverages deep learning to accurately locate and classify objects in 3D tomograms.
Step-by-Step Notebook: The dec-23.ipynb notebook provides an end-to-end guide, including data handling, model application, and visualization.
Adaptable Framework: Easily customizable for various datasets and object detection tasks within the CryoET domain.
